# myExpenses

A demo app using Firebase and Ionic to create a sharing roomies expense app.

You can view a demo  here : [WEB DEMO]

I'm sharing this project because there is a lack of finished open source app using IONIC.

I will be updating this regularly, and more than appreciate anybody helping out and contributing to this project.

**ATTENTION** : This application is by no means finished and is an ongoing project. :)

## Features
- Login / Register via Firebase AUTH
- Basic Navigation
- Translate Integrated (English / French atm, but you can add many more.) 
- Lot's more to come

## Installing

To install and preview this app on your phone
- Create an blank starter APP using IONIC (Follow the awesome offical docs)
- Replace the content in the WWW folder with the content of this GIT.
- And then preview your app as usual.
